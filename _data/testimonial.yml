  testimonial: "I met Frazer over ten years ago via a mutual interest for self-development. Few people have the same level of passion for human potential, and few care as deeply as he about changing the world for the better. His guided meditations and workshops have helped many, and he always makes himself available to help anyone who needs it. Frazer has a contagious joy that will lift any group. I heartily recommend his power of inspiration to any person or organisation."

  testimonial: "I did my first Compassion Meditation with Frazer at Confest. I told him at the time I felt it had changed my life and 6 months later I couldn't agree more with my original sentiments. Every time I feel a bit off (not so loving) I try to think of my best friends and how they make me feel. Who I am around them is who I want to be - with everyone, all the time. Thinking of them helps me re-centre and offer the person in front of me the same love, ease and respect that I would afford my nearest and dearest. Enjoy!!!!"
