        <p><strong>Mindful Yoga with Frazer</strong></p>
        <p>Frazer’s&nbsp;developed this&nbsp;unique style of yoga, by taking the best from many different styles. It includes mental training as well as physical training, similar to traditional yoga, however the meditations and metaphors are designed to suit our modern life.

        <p><strong>Meditation</strong></p>
        <p>Mindfulness</p>
        Frazer's mindfulness sessions are a modern variation of the traditional mindfulness meditation to create calm and self awareness. Sessions help develop your concentration, ability to avoid distractions, and capacity to think clearly and be more goal orientated.

        Compassion and Relaxation
        &nbsp;
        Guided meditation beginning with compassion, which is designed to foster enjoyment in the care and love we all have in our lives. This deepens and strengthens your capacity to have understanding for others and feel peace. &nbsp;The session will end with a relaxation technique. &nbsp;This creates well needed deep rest, and some time to dream about the compassion you have cultivated.

        <strong>Positive Thinking and Habit Change</strong>

These skills can be applied to all areas of a person's life, eg. creating confidence, good healthy habits, enjoying your studies, being happy, clear and bright and learning faster with more efficiency.
